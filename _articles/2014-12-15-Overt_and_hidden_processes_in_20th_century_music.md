For the purpose of contributing to a clariﬁcation of the term “process”, different kinds of musical processes are investigated: A rule-determined phase shifting process in Steve Reich’s _Piano Phase_ (1966), a model for an indeterminate composition process in John Cage’s _Variations II_ (1961), a number of evolution processes in GyörgyLigeti’s _In zart ﬂiessender Bewegung_ (1976), and a generative process of fractal nature inPer Nørgård’s
_Second Symphony_ (1970). In conclusion I propose that six process categories should be included in a typology of processes: Rule-determined, goal-directed and indeterminate transformation processes, and rule-determined, goal-directed and indeterminate generative processes.
