For the purpose of contributing to a clariﬁcation of the term “process”, different kinds of musical processes are investigated: A rule-determined phase shifting process in Steve Reich’s
Piano Phase
(1966), a model for an indeterminate compositionprocess in John Cage’s
Variations II 
(1961), a number of evolution processes in GyörgyLigeti’s
In zart ﬂiessender Bewegung
(1976), and a generative process of fractal nature inPer Nørgård’s
Second Symphony
(1970). Inconclusion I propose that sixprocess categoriesshould be included in a typology of processes: Rule-determined, goal-directed and inde-terminate transformation processes, and rule-determined, goal-directed and indeterminategenerative processes
