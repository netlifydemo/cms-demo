The specific regions of the brain are integrated in extended functional systems. Two neuroscience scholars, Gerald Edelman and Antonio Damasio, have proposed comprehensive theoretical ac-counts of these brain systems. Their ideas contribute to a global understanding of the interaction of sensory and motor systems, emotion, memory and consciousness. Gerald Edelman, in collaboration with his younger colleague Giulio Tononi, has summed up his ideas in *A Universe of Consciousness*. *How Matter Becomes Imagination* (2000). Antonio Damasio has gathered his neuroscientific insight in *Self Comes to Mind. Constructing the Conscious Brain* (2010).
