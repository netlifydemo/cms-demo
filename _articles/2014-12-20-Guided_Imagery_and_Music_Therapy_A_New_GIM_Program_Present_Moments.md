What is ‘music’ to one person’s ears is often offensive to another’s.
Many music listeners will agree with this statement by neuroscientist Robert Zatorre (2005:315).Some of these music listeners may feel profound disappointment when they realize that the kind of music they value highly is disliked strongly by other listeners.Contemporary art music is disliked by many devoted lovers of major-minor based classical mu-sic, and only to a limited extent utilized in music therapy. In continuation of the investigations of 20thCentury music carried out in *The Musical Timespace*, it was the author’s intention to assess whether art music composed during the last hundred years might be accepted or rejected in receptive musictherapy. In order to pursue this objective, he proposed a collaboration with an experienced GIM therapist, aimed at creating a new GIM program.
